# miR_RF Tool Description

The miR_RF Tool is a predictive tool for evaluating pre-microRNAs based on machine learning. It consists of Python and R scripts designed to process RNAfold output, extract features, perform machine learning analysis, and generate predictions.

### Overview

The miR_RF Tool is comprised of Python and R scripts:
- **Python Script:**
  - Extracts features from pre-miRNAs present in RNAfold output files.
  - Converts extracted features into numerical format and produces an intermediate file for R processing.
- **R Script:**
  - Performs machine learning analysis on the intermediate file generated by the Python script.
  - Generates a text file containing predictions for each pre-miRNA in the input.

### Input Requirements
The tool accepts RNAfold output files as input, structured in the following format:
- A file with a header line starting with ">" followed by five subsequent lines for each pre-miRNA.
- Multi-FASTA format is also supported.

### Usage

1. **Python Script (Preprocessing)**
   - Input: RNAfold output file.
   - Output: Intermediate file with extracted features.

2. **R Script (Machine Learning)**
   - Input: Intermediate file generated by the Python script.
   - Output: Text file with predictions (2 for YES, 1 for NO) for each pre-miRNA.

### Input Example

Sample input file structure:

```plaintext
>pre-miRNA_1
ACGUAGCUAGCUAGCUAGC...
...
```

### Output Example

The output file contains pre-miRNA names and their corresponding predictions:

```plaintext
pre-miRNA_1 2
pre-miRNA_2 1
pre-miRNA_3 2
```
